                In this game, you play as Fröggie, a young frog with a simple goal of going to space.
                Join Fröggie as they jump and swing through
                different levels, all while collecting star pieces, on their path to space. 
            </p>

                The game was designed to run on a custom arcade machine which was donated to the Bain Lab at Queen's University. Frog Goes to Space was awarded
                1st place in the Queen's IEEE Student Project Competition. While this website was originally built for hosting our beta tests it now exists 
                as a place to play the final version online for free! We hope you enjoy :)
