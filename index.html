                In this game, you play as Fröggie, a young frog with a simple goal of going to space.
                In the completed game, the player will control Fröggie as they jump and swing through five
                different levels, all while collecting star pieces, on their path to space.
            </p>

                In this short demo, there is only one playable level. Several art assets and animations are incorrect or
                missing; we are looking mostly for feedback on the core movement mechanics (walking, jumping, swinging),
                and we hope that the lack of animations does not detract from the core gameplay experience.
                An explanation of the controls can be found below the game window. You will need to click
                on the game window in order to play.
                We hope you enjoy!
